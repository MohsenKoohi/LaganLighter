# [LaganLighter:  Structure-Aware High-Performance Graph Algorithms](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/LaganLighter/)

This repository contains the shared-memory CPU-based soure code of the LaganLighter project: https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/LaganLighter .   

### Algorithms in This Repo
 - [SAPCo Sort, Parallel Counting Sort for Data with Skewed Frequency Distribution](docs/1.0-sapco.md): `alg1_sapco_sort`
 - [Thrifty Label Propagation Connected Components](docs/2.0-thrifty.md): `alg2_thrifty`
 - [MASTIFF: Structure-Aware Mimum Spanning Tree/Forest](docs/3.0-mastiff.md): `alg3_mastiff`
 - [Random Vertex Relabelling](docs/4.0-random-relabeling.md): `alg4_randomize`
 - [Random Memory Benchmarking](docs/5.0-random-mem-bench.md): `alg5_rand_mem_bench`
 - [PoTra Graph Transposition](docs/6.0-potra.md): `alg6_potra`
  - [iHTL: in-Hub Temporal Locality in SpMV](docs/7.0-ihtl.md): to be added
 - [LOTUS: Locality Optimizing Trinagle Counting](docs/8.0-lotus.md): to be added

### Cloning 
`git clone https://github.com/MohsenKoohi/LaganLighter.git --recursive`

### Updating through `pull`
- `git pull --recurse-submodules` or
- You may set recursive submodule update globally using `git config --global submodule.recurse true` and then `git pull` fetches all updates.

### Requirements
1. The `libnuma`, `openmp`, and `papi` are required. 
2. A `gcc` with a version greater than 9 are required.
3. For using ParaGrapher, `JDK` with a version greater than 15 is required.
4. `unzip`, `bc`,  and `wget`.

### Compiling and Executing Code
 - Make sure the requried libraries are accessible through `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
 - Run `make alg...` (e.g. `make alg1_sapco_sort`). This builds the executible file and runs it for the test graph. 
 - For identifying input graph and other options, please refer to [LaganLighter Documents, Loading Graphs](docs/0.2-loading.md).
 
### How Does LaganLighter Work?

Please refer to [LaganLighter Documentation](docs/readme.md)

### Supported Graph Types & Loading Graphs
LaganLighter supports reading graphs in *text* format and in compressed *[WebGraph](https://webgraph.di.unimi.it/)* format, using
[ParaGrapher](https://github.com/MohsenKoohi/ParaGrapher) library, 
particularly:
  - *`PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_400_AP`*, 
  - *`PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_404_AP`*, and
  - *`PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_800_AP`* .

Please refer to [Graph Loading Documentation](docs/0.2-loading.md).

### Processing Multiple Graphs 

Please refer to [Launcher Script Documentaion](docs/0.3-launcher.md).
