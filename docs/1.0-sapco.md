#  LaganLighter Docs: SAPCo Sort

While counting sort has a better complexity than comparison-based sorting algorithms, 
its parallelization suffers from high performance overhead and/or has a memory complexity 
that depends on the numbers of threads and elements.

In this paper, we explore the optimization of parallel counting sort for degree-ordering of 
real-world graphs with skewed degree distribution and we introduce the Structure-Aware Parallel 
Counting (SAPCo) Sort algorithm that leverages the skewed degree distribution to accelerate sorting.

The evaluation for graphs of up to 3.6 billion vertices shows that SAPCo sort is, 
on average, 1.7-33.5 times faster than state-of-the-art sorting algorithms such as 
counting sort, radix sort, and sample sort.
