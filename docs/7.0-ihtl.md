#  LaganLighter Docs: Exploiting in-Hub Temporal Locality for SpMV Graph Processing

[DOI: 10.1145/3472456.3472462](https://doi.org/10.1145/3472456.3472462)

We introduce in-Hub Temporal Locality (iHTL) as a structure-aware and cache-friendly graph traversal that optimizes locality in pull traversal. iHTL identifies different blocks in the adjacency matrix of a graph and applies a suitable traversal direction (push or pull) for each block based on its contents. In other words, iHTL optimizes locality of one traversal of all edges of the graph by:

1. Applying push direction for flipped blocks containing edges to in-hubs, and
2. Applying pull direction for processing sparse block containing edges to non-hubs.

Moreover, iHTL introduces a new algorithm to efficiently identify the number of flipped blocks by investigating connection between hub vertices of the graph. This allows iHTL to create flipped blocks as much as the graph structure requires and makes iHTL suitable for a wide range of different real-world graph datasets like social networks and web graphs.

iHTL is 1.5× – 2.4× faster than pull and 4.8× – 9.5× faster than push in state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks. More importantly, iHTL is 1.3× – 1.5× faster than pull traversal of state-of-the-art locality optimizing reordering algorithms such as SlashBurn, GOrder, and Rabbit-Order while reduces the preprocessing time by 780×, on average.
