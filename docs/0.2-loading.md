#  LaganLighter Docs: Graph Types, Loading Graphs & Running Algorithms

## Graph Types

LaganLighter supports the following graph formats:

 - CSR/CSC graph in **textual** format, for testing. This format has 4 lines: 
 	1. The number of vertices (|V|), 
 	2. The number of edges (|E|), 
 	3. |V| space-separated numbers showing offsets of the vertices, and 
 	4. |E| space-separated numbers indicating edges.
 
 - Compressed CSR/CSC graphs in [WebGraph](https://webgraph.di.unimi.it/) format are supported by 
 integrating [ParaGrapher](https://github.com/MohsenKoohi/ParaGrapher) as a submodule.

## Running Algorithms

Environment variables may be passed to `make` to specify the input graph:

  - `LL_INPUT_GRAPH_PATH`: path to the graph. The default value is `data/test_csr.txt`

  - `LL_INPUT_GRAPH_TYPE`: type of the graph which can be
    - *`text`*, 
    - *`PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_400_AP`* (graphs with 4 Bytes vertex IDs and no weights), 
    - *`PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_404_AP`* (graphs with 4 Bytes vertex IDs and 4 Bytes `uint` edge weights), or 
    - *`PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_800_AP`* (graphs with 8 Bytes vertex IDs and no weights).
      
    The default value is `text`.
    
    Please refer to [ParaGrapher Documentation](https://github.com/MohsenKoohi/ParaGrapher/wiki/API-Documentation)
  for more details about ParaGrapher types.

  - `LL_INPUT_GRAPH_IS_SYMMETRIC`: with a value of `0` or `1`, specifies if the 
  input graph is symmetric. The default value is 0.
  Using this variable for symmetric graphs will help algorithms the dataset to be passed directly (and without symmetrization) 
  to algorithms that require a symmetric graph input.

  - `LL_INPUT_GRAPH_BATCH_ORDER`: is used by `launcher.sh` script to inform the program the batch order of current  
  dataset. Default is 0.

  - `LL_STORE_INPUT_GRAPH_IN_SHM`: with a value of `0` or `1`, specifies if it is required 
  to store a copy of the graph as a shared memory object (i.e. in `/dev/shm`). 
  The default value is 0. It is useful when the size of input graph(s) is large and some 
  experiments are repeated multiple times on the graphs. In this case and by storing the graphs as shared memory objects,
  it is not required to load them from the storage.

  - `LL_OUTPUT_REPORT_PATH`: specifies the path to the report file, if it is required. It is used by `launcher.sh` script
  to aggregate results for all processed datasets. Default value is `NULL`.

To run a single algorithm, it is enough to call `make alg...`, e.g., `make alg1_sapco_sort`. 
It runs the algorithm for the default options (stated in the above). To run the algorithm for a particular graph,
you may need to pass the above variables. 
E.g., `LL_INPUT_GRAPH_PATH=data/cnr-2000 LL_INPUT_GRAPH_TYPE=PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_400_AP make alg1_sapco_sort` calls the algorithm
for the `data/cnr-2000`. 

The following variables may be set when calling `make`:
  - `threads=t` sets the number of concurrent threads to `t`. Without this, threads number is set to to number of logical threads.
  - `no_ht=1` disables hyperthreading when `threads=t` is absent. 
  - `debug=1` enables debugging (-g of gcc)
  - `wait_passive=1` sets [`OMP_WAIT_POLICY`](https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.0/openmpse55.html) 
  to `passive` instead of its default value which is `active`,
  - `energy=1` activates [energy measurement](0.4-energy.md).
  
E.g., `make alg1_sapco_sort no_ht=1 wait_passive=1`.

## How Does LaganLighter Load a Graph?

For *textual* graphs (formatted above), it is required to call `get_ll_400_txt_graph()`. 
To load the graphs in *WebGraph* format (using ParaGrapher), functions `get_ll_400_webgraph()`
and `get_ll_404_webgraph()` should be called. These 3 functions have been defined in [`graph.c`](../graph.c) and
load the graph in the following steps:

  - Checking if the graph has been stored as a shared memory object. In that case the graph is returned to the user
  by calling `get_shm_ll_400_graph()` and `get_shm_ll_404_graph()`. This graph should be released by calling 
  `release_shm_ll_400_graph()` or `release_shm_ll_404_graph()`.
	
  - If the graph is not found in the shared memory, the graph is loaded/decompressed from the secondary storage and
  a NUMA-interleaved memory is allocated for the graph. This graph should be released by calling
  `release_numa_interleaved_ll_400_graph()` or `release_numa_interleaved_ll_404_graph()`. 

    *Note*: The graphs are loaded before calling `initialize_omp_par_env()` which initializes OpenMP threads
    (to prevent busy wait of the OpenMP threads initialized by `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=active`, by default). 
    The `get_ll_400_txt_graph()` function reads textual graphs sequentially and `get_ll_40X_webgraph()` functions
    call the ParaGrapher library which uses the `pthread` for parallelization.

  - When the graph is loaded/decompressed from the secondary storage, the OS caches some contents of the graph
  in memory. This cached data by OS may impact the performance of algorithms especially when a large percentage of the
  memory is used. To prevent this, by the end of graph loading, the `flush_os_cache()` functions is used to run th e
  [`flushcache.sh`](../flushcache.sh) script.
  If the user has `sudo` access, a script can be added for this purpose (Please refer 
  to the comments on the first lines of [`flushcache.sh`](../flushcache.sh)).
