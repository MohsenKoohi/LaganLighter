#  LaganLighter Docs: Energy Measurement

In order to measure energy consumed during the execution, it is required to pass `energy=1` to `make`, or
include it to `make-args`, if using the [`launcher`](0.3-launcher.md). This enables `_ENERGY_MEASUREMENT` in 
[`energy.c`](../energy.c).

Energy measurement also requires accessing energy counters. In function `energy_measurement_init()` in
[`energy.c`](../energy.c), the suitable functions are called. In folder [`energy`](../energy), there is 
a code for reading energy counters on AMD Zen2-4 CPUs, [`apm-read.c`](../energy/AMD/apm-read.c) (requires
`sudo` access), and a script for reading energy counters on Intel CPUs, [`rapl_read.sh`](../energy/Intel/rapl_read.sh).

A simple code for accessing energy counters is in the following

```
	// Initializing in the beginning
	#ifdef _ENERGY_MEASUREMENT
		struct energy_measurement* em = energy_measurement_init();
		energy_measurement_start(em);
	#endif


	// Performing the computation


	// Retrieving energy values
	#ifdef _ENERGY_MEASUREMENT
		{
			struct energy_counters_vals* evals = energy_measurement_stop(em);
			printf("Energy consumption:\n");
			printf("  Packages energy : %'.2f (J)\n", evals->packages_total/1e6);
			printf("  DRAM energy     : %'.2f (J)\n", evals->drams_total/1e6);
			printf("  Total energy    : %'.2f (J)\n", (evals->packages_total + evals->drams_total)/1e6);
			
			// energy_measurement_print(evals);
			evals = NULL;
			energy_measurement_release(em);
			em = NULL;
		}
	#endif

```
