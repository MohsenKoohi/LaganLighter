#  LaganLighter Docs: Random Vertex Relabelling

To evaluate the impacts of locality-optimizing reordering algorithms, a baseline
is required. To create the baseline a random assignment of IDs to vertices may be used
to produce a representation of the graph with reduced 
locality \[
[DOI:10.1109/ISPASS57527.2023.00029](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS57527.2023.00029),
[DOI:10.1109/IISWC53511.2021.00020](https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC53511.2021.00020)
\].

To that end, we create the `random_ordering()` function in [relabel.c](../relabel.c) file.
It consists a number of iterations. In each iteration, concurrent threads traverse the list
of vertices and assign them new IDs. The function uses [xoshiro](https://prng.di.unimi.it/) 
\[[DOI:10.1145/3460772](https://doi.org/10.1145/3460772)\]
to produce random numbers.

The [alg4_randomize](../alg4_randomize.c) tests this function for a number of graphs.
For each dataset, an initial plot of 
degree distribution of Neighbor to Neighbor Average ID Distance (**N2N AID**)
\[[DOI:10.1109/IISWC53511.2021.00020](https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC53511.2021.00020)\]
is created. Also, after each iteration of `random_ordering()` the N2N AID distribution
is plotted. This shows the impacts of randomization.

The complete results for all graphs can be seen in 
[this PDF file](https://hpgp.net/LaganLighter/outputs/alg4/alg4_randomize.pdf).
The results for some graphs are in the following.

*Note:* the algorithm has been run on graphs containing outgoing edges of each vertex.

The algorithm has been executed on a machine with two AMD 7401 CPUs, 128 cores, 128 threads. 
The report created by the [`launcher`](0.3-launcher.md) is in the following.
